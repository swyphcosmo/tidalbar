# TIDALbar

A very unofficial CLI player for the [TIDAL music streaming service](http://tidal.com). 

This project is built upon the excellent [tidalapi](https://github.com/tamland/python-tidal) and [python-mpv](https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv) libraries. 

Using tidalapi, it is possible to acquire the RTMP URLs for tracks on TIDAL. [mpv](https://mpv.io) is used to fetch and play the RTMP stream.
